    •	Items: Rooms can have a multitude of items
    •	Description: All rooms have a unique description.
    •	Locked feature: Certain rooms will only allow the player to enter if they have an item that satisfies the condition. 
    •	All rooms have a RoomLabel (id) for better equality checks when verifying the location of the player.

    •	Items have a description and weight. (Weight value is not used, only displayed).
    •	Certain items have an id associated with them. These items are functional to the game in that they can unlock certain pathways to rooms if they are present in the player’s inventory.
    •	Items can be dropped anywhere in the game. (If the item is “The One Ring” and it is dropped in the Mordor room, the game will end).
